Guess Number Higher or Lower
Easy

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns 3 possible results:

    -1: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. pick < num).
    1: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. pick > num).
    0: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. pick == num).

Return the number that I picked.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1

Example 4:

Input: n = 2, pick = 2
Output: 2
